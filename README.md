Several Form UI Demos (built with Bootstrap, jQuery & AngularJS) [WIP]
======================================================================

This Form UI [demo](http://jhkueh.github.com/demo-formUI-esc/index.html) (built with Bootstrap, jQuery & AngularJS) is something that I had been working on for a NGO.

* It is responsive (try resizing the width of the browser's window).
* Users can click on the radio button's table cell to select it.
* However, users cannot select both radio buttons (Most & Least) of the same row (handles by jQuery).

Try out the demo [here](http://jhkueh.github.com/demo-formUI-esc/index.html) (hosted on github <-thanks).

*Note: There are now several other demos too.
