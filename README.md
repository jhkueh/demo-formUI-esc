A Form UI Demo (built with Bootstrap & jQuery) [WIP]
==================================================

This Form UI demo (built with Bootstrap & jQuery) is something that I had been working on for a NGO.

* It is responsive (try resizing the width of the browser's window).
* Users can click on the radio button's table cell to select it.
* However, users cannot select both radio buttons (Most & Least) of the same row (handles by jQuery).
